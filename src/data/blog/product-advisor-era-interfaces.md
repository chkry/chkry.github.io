###### **Title:** Empowering Underserved Indian Engineering Students: My Journey as a Product Advisor for [Era Interfaces](https://www.erainterfaces.com/home)

**Introduction:**

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a lot of disruption in education systems worldwide, leaving millions of students without access to quality education. As a product advisor at Era Interfaces, I was lucky enough to work with an amazing team of engineers, designers, and educators to develop EdTech solutions that could help underserved Indian college students studying engineering during the pandemic.

**Challenges Faced by Indian College Students during the Pandemic:**

The pandemic has made it even harder for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to access education. The lack of resources, qualified teachers, and infrastructure is a significant obstacle to academic progress. With the sudden shift to remote learning, many students felt lonely, disconnected, and unsupported, which made it even harder for them to succeed in their studies.

**My Role as a Product Advisor at Era Interfaces:**

As a product advisor, I worked with my team to create EdTech solutions that were tailored to the specific needs of Indian engineering students. We wanted to help them overcome the challenges they faced during the pandemic and access quality education.

**Identifying Student Needs:**

We knew that we had to start by understanding the needs of the students we were trying to help. We conducted extensive research and surveys to gather insights from students and educators, ensuring that our solutions were user-centered and truly reflected the needs of the students.

**Creating Engaging and Accessible Learning Platforms:**

We focused on creating interactive and accessible learning platform that could offer a rich learning experience. We used technology to develop web and mobile apps that had multimedia resources, interactive quizzes, and virtual laboratories. This allowed students to access quality education from anywhere, at any time.

**Personalized Learning and Mentorship:**

We knew that personalized guidance was essential, so we created personal training program and learning paths based on each student's strengths, weaknesses, and learning styles. We also established a mentorship program that connected students with industry professionals and experienced educators who could provide guidance, career advice, and support throughout their academic journey.

**Affordability and Accessibility:**

We were committed to making our EdTech solutions affordable and accessible. We partnered with educational institutions to secure funding and offer subsidized access to the platforms. We also made sure that our products could be accessed on low-end devices and had options for offline learning, catering to students with limited internet connectivity.

**Building a Supportive Community:**

We understood the importance of fostering a sense of community among students, so we facilitated online forums, discussion boards, and virtual networking events. We wanted to encourage collaboration, knowledge sharing, and peer-to-peer support. By creating a supportive environment, we aimed to inspire a sense of belonging and motivation among students, enhancing their overall learning experience.

**Conclusion:**

As a product advisor at Era Interfaces, I had the privilege of contributing to the development of EdTech solutions that empowered underserved Indian college students pursuing engineering degrees during the challenging times of the pandemic. 

By creating accessible and personalized learning platforms, fostering mentorship programs, and building a supportive community, we aimed to bridge the educational divide and ensure that no student was left behind.

I am very proud of the impact our work has had on the lives of these talented individuals and are committed to refining and expanding our offerings to reach even more underserved students across India.

Thank you Era Interfaces Team for your invaluable support in creating the learning platform. Your expertise and dedication were instrumental in making it a success, and you helped me learn a lot during this time.
